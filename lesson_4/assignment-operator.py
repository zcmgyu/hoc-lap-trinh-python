# Python Assignment Operators

## Assignment Operator

x1 = 10

print("x1 = ", x1)

## Addition Assignment Operator

x2 = 10

x2 += 20 # -> x2 = x2 + 20

print("x2 = ", x2)

## Subtraction Assignment Operator

x3 = 10

x3 -= 20 # -> x3 = x3 - 20

print("x3 = ", x3)

## Multiplication Assignment Operator

x4 = 10

x4 *= 20 # -> x4 = x4 * 20

print("x4 = ", x4)

## Division Assignment Operator

x5 = 10

x5 /= 20 # -> x5 = x5 / 20

print("x5 = ", x5)

## Modulus Assignment Operator

x6 = 7

x6 %= 2 # -> x6 = x6 % 2

print("x6 = ", x6)

## Exponentiation Assignment Operator

x7 = 2

x7 **= 3 # -> x7 = x7 ** 3

print("x7 = ", x7)

## Floor Division Assignment Operator

x8 = 10

x8 //= 3 # -> x8 = x8 // 3

print("x8 = ", x8)

## Bitwise AND Assignment Operator

x9 = 10 # 1010

x9 &= 2 # -> x9 = x9 & 2

print("x9 = ", x9)

## Bitwise OR Assignment Operator

x10 = 10 # 1010

x10 |= 2 # -> x10 = x10 | 2

print("x10 = ", x10)

## Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator

x11 = 10 # 1010

x11 ^= 2 # -> x11 = x11 ^ 2

print("x11 = ", x11)

## Bitwise Left Shift Assignment Operator

x12 = 10 # 1010

x12 <<= 2 # -> x12 = x12 << 2

print("x12 = ", x12)

## Bitwise Right Shift Assignment Operator

x13 = 10 # 1010

x13 >>= 2 # -> x13 = x13 >> 2

print("x13 = ", x13)
